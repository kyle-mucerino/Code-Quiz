For our project we created a code quiz game. 

The index.html page has a header describing the game and a paragraph underneath it describing the rules of the game. There is a timer in the right corner of the page that countsdown from 60 when the game begins. Underneath the game's instructions is a start quiz button with the tag <button>. When the game starts the questions appear with choices. When the game ends your score is shown and a window to submit the users' initials appears using the <input> tag. We have two script sources for our javascript code. We then have a feedback class to show whether the user got the question correct or incorrect. 

The javascript script.js has a questionIndex  starting at 0 variable, time variable of 60, and a timer variable. We used a querySelector to access the id's questions, time, choices, start, submit, initials, and feedback. The function startQuiz  using the startScreen variable and a querySelector to access the start screen id. We then hid the start screen using setAttribute. The timer is set on a countdown of 1000miliseconds which equals 1 second. The loadQuestion function is called to load the first quesiton. function coundown is used to set the timer to countdwon by increments of 1 and if time runs out (<=0) then endQuiz function ends the quiz. The loadQuestion function has a currentQuestion variable that pulls questions from the questionIndex array we have created in another javascript question.js. Then a querySelector is used to access id question-title and that becomes the current question. We use a for loop to move through the array of questions incremented by one. We use creatElement to create the buttons for the answer choices. 
We check the answer with the checkAnswer function with an event. We use the button variable with event target. we use if to check whether the user answer (btn.value) matches the answer pulled from the answer array of the questionIndex. then we set our time variable to subtract by 15 seconds and if there was under 15 seconds when a question was answered incorrectly the time will go to 0 not negative. We then use textContent to show incorrect through the feedback element or else correct if the user selects the correct answer. We use setAttribute and setTimeout to display the feedback for 1000 miliseconds = 1 second and then back to hiding the feedback. We then use questionIndex to move through our question index array  by increments of one. We then use an if statement to call the endQuiz function by setting the if statement to when time is less than or equal to zero or when the questionIndex reaches the length of the questionIndez array. Then the endQUiz function is called to end the quiz or else the next question loads using an else statement and the loadQuestion function.When the quiz ends we clear the timer and use a querySelector to the end screen id and use removeAttribute to remove its class of "hide" so the end screen appears and is no longer hidden. Then we use setAttribute to hide the questions and a querySelector to access the final score of the user. The saveScore function includes the initials variablle whuch we first set to trim in case the user submits initials with extra space and then use JSON.parse to acces the localStorage and getItem of scores to save the user scores. Var userScore is used to set the user's score to be equal to the amount of time left in the game. scores.push(userScore) then adds the userScore to the existing array of scores. JSON.stringify to convert the scores into a string. The checkForSubmission function includes an if statement stating if the user clicks submit then the saveScore function is called using event.key and setting it euqal to Submit. We use onclick with the submitbtn, startbtn, and choicesEl and set them equal to saveScore, startQuiz, and checkAnswer respectively to call those functions when the user clicks submit, start, or an answer choice. onkeyup is used with initialsEl to checkForSubmission when the user enters their initials and hits the submit button.
